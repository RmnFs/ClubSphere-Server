Project Name: ClubSphere – Membership & Event Management for Local Clubs

Project Overview and Discussion
Project Theme
ClubSphere is a web application that helps people discover, join, and manage local clubs (for example: photography clubs, hiking groups, book clubs, tech clubs). Through ClubSphere, club managers can create and manage clubs and events, and members can join clubs, pay membership fees, and register for events. An admin oversees the entire platform.

What is the Project?
A full-stack MERN application for managing:


Local clubs and their details


Club memberships (free or paid)


Club events and member registrations


Admin-level monitoring of users, clubs, and payments


It will include authentication, three roles, role-based dashboards, secure payment with Stripe, and modern frontend tools like React Hook Form and TanStack Query.


How the system works (High-level Flow)
Member can:


Browse clubs and events


Join clubs (paying membership fee if required via Stripe)


View and manage their memberships and event registrations in their dashboard


Admin can:


Approve or reject club registration requests


Promote/demote users to “Club Manager” role


Monitor all payments and platform statistics


Club Manager can:


Create and update their club profile


Set membership fee (optional: free or paid)


Create events for their club


View and manage members and event registrations

Deployment Guidelines
If deployment is not correct, you may get 0 and lose rewards.
Ensure your server works perfectly on production:


No CORS / 404 / 504 issues for valid routes.


Ensure your Live Link works and does not throw errors on landing.


Ensure that the page does not throw any error on reloading from any route.


Add your deployed domain in Firebase authorized domains (Netlify / Surge / Vercel).


Logged-in users must not be redirected to Login when reloading any private route (preserve auth state).

CRUD Operations & Payment Integration
CRUD Summary
You must implement full CRUD where it makes sense:
Clubs:


Create (Club Manager)


Read (Public listing + dashboards)


Update (Club Manager, Admin)


Delete (optional: soft delete or actual delete)


Events:


Create (Club Manager)


Read (Public & dashboards)


Update (Club Manager)


Delete (Club Manager)


Memberships:


Created after successful payment or joining a free club.


Read-only by Member (their own memberships) and by Club Manager for their clubs.


Update status by Admin or Manager if required.


Event Registrations:


Create when a member registers for an event (free or paid).


Read-only for relevant Club Manager and Member.


Stripe Payment Integration
You must integrate Stripe in test mode:
Use Stripe to handle membership payments:


When a member clicks “Join Club”:


If membershipFee > 0, redirect them to a payment flow using Stripe.


After payment success, create a membership record.


If membershipFee === 0, allow joining without payment.


Basic Flow:


Client: calls backend to create a payment intent / Stripe session.


Server: handles Stripe secret key and returns client secret/session URL.


Client: confirm payment with Stripe and handle success/failure.


Make sure payment APIs are secured and used only by logged-in users.

Additional Requirements
Loading Page:


Show a loading spinner or skeleton while fetching data via TanStack Query.


Error Page:


Implement a friendly 404/Generic Error page with a “Back to Home” button.



UI Design Requirements
Unique Design:


Decide on an overall brand style for ClubSphere.


You may look at ThemeForest or other design galleries for inspiration, but do not copy any template or any previous batch project.


Keep the main heading style (font, size, color) consistent across all sections.


Keep paragraph spacing balanced and text easily readable.


Maintain uniform image sizes and spacing, especially in club and event cards.


Use consistent button styles, matching the home page.


Ensure good spacing and proper alignment in all sections.


Navbar: keep logo/heading style consistent across all pages and dashboard.


Use a grid layout with equal image sizes for club/event listings.


Keep all cards equal height and width where possible.


Use the latest X logo (not the old Twitter bird) if you include social links.


Responsiveness: the site must be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.



Dashboard UI Requirements
Responsive design for mobile and tablet.


Consistent color theme between public site and dashboard.


Full-width dashboard layout on desktop (no cramped narrow layout).


Show a user profile section in the dashboard (name, email, role, photo, edit button if implemented).



Challenge Requirements
These are must-have challenge features. They carry extra marks and reflect advanced skills.
Search & Filter (Clubs and Events)


Implement server-side search/filter on clubs and events.


Requirements:


Search by clubName for /clubs.


Filter by category.



Token Verification (Firebase Token)


Protect dashboard and sensitive API routes using Firebase token.


Requirements:


Use Firebase token for implementing secure token verification on the server side.


Middleware on the backend verifies the token and checks the user role for protected routes.


Sorting


Implement sorting for at least one list page (e.g., clubs or events).


Requirement:


Sort by membershipFee, eventDate, or createdAt using MongoDB .sort().


Provide options like “Newest First”, “Oldest First”, “Highest Fee”, “Lowest Fee”.


React Hook Form & Tanstack Query


Use react hook form in login, register, create club, create events etc.


Use tanstack query for data fetching and mutations. Make sure to use useQuery and useMutation hook properly.

Optional Requirements Guideline
Some ideas:
Club Announcements / Posts


Club managers can post announcements to club members (simple text posts).


Members see them in their dashboard.


Reviews / Ratings for Clubs


Members can rate a club and leave a review.


Show average rating on club cards.


Multiple Membership Types (Free vs Premium)


Clubs can define multiple membership tiers (Basic / Premium) with different fees.


Members choose the tier during joining.


Bookmark / Wishlist for Clubs or Events


Members can bookmark clubs/events they’re interested in.


Separate “Wishlist” tab in member dashboard.


Multi-language Support (Basic)


Add a simple language toggle (e.g., English/Bangla) for main texts.
